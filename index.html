                        I started taking piano lessons when I was six years old and became interested in music as a child. 
                        Every day I trained hard, no matter how tiring and exhausting it may seem. 
                        My dedication paid off when I rose to prominence as a pianist performing in front of the NU audience.

you will read a bunch of cool stories, and analyze choices that the authors of the stories made. 
you will write a bunch of cool stories yourself; it will be extremely fun to come up with fictional characters and create fictional problems for them.
warning: professor is strict tho, might pile a lot of work on you, but it’s even more interesting this way. (don’t say I did not warn you) 

no more courses are encouraged to take (my favorite professors just left the university)
