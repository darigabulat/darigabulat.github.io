            <b>Usharal is a city that is recently very popular among tourists.</b> Usharal is a city in the <i>east of Kazakhstan. </i> <br> It is located in the north-eastern part of Almaty region and is the administrative and economic center of Alakolsky district. The city is located in the <i>Balkhash-Alakol basin</i>, in the middle of the plain between the ranges of the Dzungarian Alatau and Tarbatagai. Usharal is a junction of highways: highways diverge from the city in the direction of Almaty, East Kazakhstan region and the border of China. A few kilometers to the east, the Aktogay – Dostyk railway line passes.

            The plain on which Usharal is located is favorable for agriculture. <br><br> The waters of the Tentek River are used for irrigation. <br> The settlement has been known since 1871 as Stanitsa Stefanovskaya. <hr> Siberian Cossacks arrived here to create a border post on the outskirts of the Russian Empire. In the 1970s, Usharal again fell into the sphere of military interests. For the reconstruction and construction of new roads, a separate road construction team was formed under the direct supervision of the USSR Ministry of Defense. In particular, the Usharal–Druzhba (now Dostyk) road leading to the border with China was laid. The main office of the brigade was stationed in Usharal. In addition, two military airfields were built in the vicinity of the settlement: Usharal-1 and Usharal-2. Since 1984, the military settlement has received the status of a city.
