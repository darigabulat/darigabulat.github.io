<h1 class="aboutme2">About me</h1>
<p class="aboutme">Can’t help being versatile. Couldn't choose between Economics and Literature, so did a double major. 
    Couldn’t choose between music and dancing, so do both. 
    I can not help but explore different interests and hobbies. 
    I could not resist the call of adventure, so I traveled to different countries and got acquainted with different cultures. 
    I cannot ignore the beauty of nature, so I often go hiking and camping. I can't help but be curious, so I always strive to learn something new and expand my knowledge. I cannot lose sight of the importance of fitness, so I include various workouts in my routine. 
    Versatility allows me to enjoy life to the fullest and never stop at one thing.
